# SF_Crime_Analysis

**Objective**:
I would like to know the nicest neighborhoods in San Francisco, in case eventually I decide to move there after I graduate.

**Data**:
Real-word data, spanning 15 years (bebore 5/15/2018), from [SF Police Department.](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/-Change-Notice-Police-Department-Incidents/tmnf-yvry)

**Results**:
I performed *spatial* and *temporal* analysis and I trained the time series data with an ARIMA model to forcast crime rates in the next year.
